# Spirograph
This is a javascript app that draws cool patterns with sticks that rotate at different speeds, stacked on top of eachother.

## TODO 
If you want to help here are some of the things you could do (and what I will be doing):
```text
[x] Add code comments
[x] Add trace modes (trace each stick, the joints between them, or just the end position)
[ ] Add colors
   [ ] A background color
   [ ] A global stick color
   [ ] A gradient between sticks
   [ ] Random or customizable palettes
[x] Add settings
   [x] HTML input tags control variables (probably already a library for this, lmk if you find one!)
   [/] Add saving and loading for stick data
   [x] Control things like line width and framerate
[ ] Add some cool pictures to the README
